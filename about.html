        that defines this incredible Nation. Embark on a journey with us as a delve into the vibrant colors
        , tantalizing flavours, and diverse landscapes that make India truly extraordinary. Whether you're a
        seasoned traveler or embarking on your first adventure, join us in uncovering the countless  treasures 
        that await around every corner.<br>India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage. 
        It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress during the last 65 years of its Independence. 
        India has become self-sufficient in agricultural production and is now one of the top industrialized countries in the world and one of the few nations to have gone into outer space to conquer nature for the benefit of the people.<br> 
        It covers an area of 32,87,263 sq.km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. 
        As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. 
        Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.<br> 
        As you travel, India offers a range of vast tourism choices, diverse in land and nature, people, tribes, cuisine, faiths, dance forms, music, arts, crafts, adventure, sport, spirituality, history; even these vary as you journey from one state to another. 
        As a country, India has achieved all-round socio-economic progress in the last 70 years of independence. 
        The change is clearly visible in the Tier I and Tier II cities. 
        However, the fascinating aspect lies in the stark difference as you travel through the new and old parts of its cities.<br> 
        From world-class airports and hotels, luxurious shopping malls, restaurants, pubs and cafes to overcrowded streets and alleyways, in the same cities, filled with thousands of little shops offering every possible modern and ethnic product and native street food is a fascinating experience.

      <div class="history"><h3>HISTORY OF INDIA</h3></div>
      <div class="brief"><h5>When many cultures were only nomadic forest dwellers over 5000 years ago, Indians established Harappan culture in Sindhu Valley (Indus Valley Civilization)
       The name 'India' is derived from the River Indus, the valleys around which were the home of the early settlers. The Aryan worshippers referred to the river Indus as the Sindhu. <br>
       The earliest known human remains in South Asia date to 30,000 years ago. Sedentariness began in South Asia around 7000 BCE by 4500 BCE, settled life had spread, and gradually evolved into the Indus Valley Civilisation, which flourished between 2500 BCE and 1900 BCE in present-day Pakistan and north-western India. 
       The pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain.<br> Around 600 BCE, a new, interregional culture arose; then, small chieftaincies (janapadas) were consolidated into larger states (mahajanapadas). Second urbanization took place, which came with the rise of new ascetic movements and religious concepts, including the rise of Jainism and Buddhism. 
       The latter was synthesized with the preexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent, giving rise to Hinduism.
