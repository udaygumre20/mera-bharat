# Mera-Bharat
Mera Bharat is a static informational website that showcases some of the most popular and culturally significant tourist destinations in India. This project was developed as my first web development project, with the main objective of learning and applying the fundamentals of front-end web technologies.

India is a country known for its rich cultural heritage, historical monuments, natural landscapes, and regional diversity. The website aims to present famous tourist places from different parts of India in a simple, informative, and visually appealing way. It helps users explore destinations and encourages interest in Indian tourism.
